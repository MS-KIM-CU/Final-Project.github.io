<h2>Exploring the Relationship Between Air Quality and Respiratory Health in NYC</h2>
<p><em>Final Project for P8105 Data Science I</em></p>
</div>

## Project Overview

Air pollution is a major public health concern in urban environments, and New York City consistently reports high rates of respiratory illnesses, particularly asthma. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is known to trigger asthma symptoms and increase emergency department (ED) visits. 

This project explores how PM2.5 levels vary across time and NYC boroughs, and whether increases in pollution are associated with higher asthma ED visit rates.

## Research Questions

1. **Temporal Trends**: How have PM2.5 levels and asthma ED visit rates changed over time in NYC (2009–2023)?

2. **Geographic Disparities**: Do boroughs differ in both PM2.5 concentration and asthma ED visit rates?

3. **Association Analysis**: Is higher PM2.5 associated with higher asthma ED visit rates after adjusting for seasonality and borough?

4. **Effect Modification**: Does season modify the association between PM2.5 and asthma ED visits?

## Data Sources

Our analysis uses two publicly available datasets from NYC government sources:

| Dataset | Source | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Air Quality (PM2.5) | [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) | Daily/monthly PM2.5 concentrations by borough |
| Asthma ED Visits | [NYC DOHMH](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/) | Borough-level asthma ED visit rates |

## Key Findings Preview

<div class="col-md-6">
**Air Quality Improvements**

- All five NYC boroughs have experienced substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations since 2009
- Manhattan showed the largest improvements, dropping from ~12.6 to ~7.3 µg/m³
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
**Health Disparities Persist**

- The Bronx consistently shows asthma ED rates 2-4x higher than other boroughs
- A positive correlation exists between PM2.5 levels and asthma ED visits
