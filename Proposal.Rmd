## Project Proposal

#### Group Members : Minseo Brenda Kim (mk5184)

#### Project Title: Bayesian Spatial Modeling of PM2.5 Air Pollution in California: Assessing Environmental Justice Through Demographic Disparities and Health Impacts

#### Motivation for this Project

Air pollution is a major health concern worldwide. Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is a type of air pollution that can enter the lungs and cause health problems. In East Asia, where my hometown is, the issue of PM2.5 has been particularly significant between China and Korea, as transboundary pollution has led to diplomatic and environmental challenges. This project builds on a prior statistical analysis of daily PM2.5 concentrations in California during 2024, which employed exploratory data analysis, variogram estimation for spatial covariance, and Bayesian hurdle-gamma modeling via JAGS to account for zero-inflation, temporal (monthly) effects, and spatial dependencies across monitoring sites. While the original work focused on modeling pollution trends and validating predictions, it highlighted significant variations influenced by events like wildfires (e.g., CZU Lightning Complex Fire). To extend this, we now incorporate environmental justice perspectives by examining how PM2.5 levels disproportionately affect minority and low-income communities, potentially linking to health outcomes such as respiratory issues or endocrine disruptions from particulate matter exposure. By integrating demographic data, we aim to quantify statistical associations between pollution, socioeconomic factors, and health, informing policies for equitable environmental monitoring and mitigation. As a data science project, the emphasis will be on advanced statistical modeling, Bayesian inference, and reproducible workflows to derive actionable insights from complex, spatially correlated data.

#### Intended Final Products

-   An interactive R Shiny dashboard for exploring PM2.5 trends, spatial maps, demographic overlays, and model predictions, with filters for sites, months, and demographic variables.

-   A detailed report in Quarto format, including methodology, results, statistical interpretations, and policy implications.

-   A GitHub repository with all code, data pipelines, model scripts (e.g., JAGS files), and documentation for reproducibility.

-   A 3-5 minute video walkthrough of key findings and the dashboard, uploaded to the repository.

#### Anticipated Data Sources

-   EPA Air Quality System (AQS) Daily PM2.5 Data for California (e.g., pm25_daily_2024_california.csv or updated 2025 data via <https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html>) for concentration measurements at monitoring sites.

-   U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) Demographics for California for socioeconomic indicators like income, race/ethnicity, and population density at census tract levels near sites.

-   USGS or California Air Resources Board (CARB) geospatial data for site coordinates and additional air quality metrics.

-   CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network for California for health outcome data, such as asthma rates or endocrine-related hospitalizations linked to air pollution.

-   Wildfire event data from CAL FIRE or NOAA to annotate temporal spikes.

#### Planned Analyses/Visualization/Coding Challenges

This project extends the prior hurdle-gamma model by incorporating demographic covariates and enhancing spatial-temporal analyses, focusing on statistical rigor in a data science context. Key elements include:

-   **Data Integration and Preprocessing**: Merge PM2.5 data with census demographics and health outcomes using R packages like dplyr, tidyr, and sf for spatial joins. Handle zero-inflation and filter to key sites (e.g., Concord, Livermore, Oakland, San Francisco, Vallejo, Woodland-Gibson Road). Challenges: Managing large datasets with spatial mismatches and imputing missing values via multiple imputation (e.g., mice package).

-   **Exploratory and Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary stats, ACF/PACF for temporal autocorrelation, and empirical variograms (via gstat) for spatial structure. Test demographic disparities using t-tests or ANOVA (e.g., mean PM2.5 by income quartile).

-   **Advanced Modeling**: Extend the Bayesian hurdle model in JAGS to include demographic interactions (e.g., race/income as predictors in the positive component) and spatial covariance (exponential model from prior variogram fit). Use generalized additive models (GAM via mgcv) or spatial regression (spdep) as baselines for comparison. Incorporate hypothesis testing (e.g., credible intervals for coefficients) to assess if minority/low-income areas show significantly higher PM2.5-health associations. Challenges: Addressing convergence issues in JAGS, handling multicollinearity in demographics, and computing posterior predictive checks for model validation (e.g., RMSE by site/demographic group).

-   **Visualizations**: Boxplots/violin plots for PM2.5 distributions by site and demographic group; line plots for monthly trends with wildfire annotations; interactive spatial maps (leaflet) overlaying pollution heatmaps on demographic choropleths; trace/density plots for MCMC diagnostics. Include uncertainty via confidence/credible intervals.

-   **Coding Challenges**: Optimizing JAGS runs for large samples (e.g., parallel chains with rjags); ensuring reproducibility with renv for package management; dealing with spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I tests) to refine models.

#### Planned Timeline

-   Week 1: Collect and preprocess data; integrate demographics and perform initial EDA.

-   Week 2: Compute variograms, build exploratory visualizations, and run preliminary statistical tests on disparities.

-   Week 3: Develop and fit extended Bayesian models; validate with diagnostics and predictions.

-   Week 4: Finalize analyses, create visualizations, and draft report; record video.
